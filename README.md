# Fitnesse-Demos
Demonstration of Fitnesse Testing Framework

In this project, I have written some simple Java classes with some basic functionality (such as Math Utilities). In order to demostrate the power of Fitnesse, I have written some "fixture code" (such as a short class called "MathFixture.java" that works in between the functionality of the codebase such as "MathUtilities.java" and the Fitnesse test cases stored in "FitnesseTestPageContent\content.txt".

Using simple test cases that can be imported as an Excel spreadsheet, and by running Fitnesse as its own standalone wiki server, this project demonstrates the usefulness of Fitnesse to support vast sets of test coverages with a single run of a test page on the Fitnesse wiki.

All credit to the developers and contributors who support Fitnesse. For reference, see http://www.fitnesse.org/ or the codebase of Fitnesse itself here: https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse.
